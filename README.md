# sk8bot!

## Description:
Sk8bot is a discord bot I made for a server with my friends. It can assign and remove roles and has many fun interactions with users. It can tell jokes, share fun facts, give inspiration, give reccomendations on anime based on genre or from users of anime recommendation sites. 

## APIS used:
Via the RapidAPI API Hub:
- MyAnimeList: https://rapidapi.com/felixeschmittfes/api/myanimelist/
- AniList GraphQL: https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/anilist-graphql/
Via the APINinjas API Hub:
- Jokes: https://api-ninjas.com/api/jokes
- Fun Facts: https://api-ninjas.com/api/facts
Other:
- Inspirational Quotes: https://zenquotes.io/

## Future additions planned:
I want to perfect the genre based reccomendation in the furture. Unfortunately due to the errors in pagination for the MyAnimeList API, the recommendations are less random than I would like (espescially for more niche genres) and the code also isn't as clean or brief as it could be. I am going to look into other ways to achieve this with the MyAnimeList API and will also look for other APIs that I could use to better implement this feature.

A newer idea I have for this bot is for it to be able to give daily weather forecasts on command. Since this server has members from serveral different locations, the forecast would also take city into consideration.
